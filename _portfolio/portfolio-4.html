Conventional Channel estimation and qualization for OFDM is a pretty mature technique, but Deep learning has emerged to 

as an effective tool for channel estimation in wireless communication systems
but would Deep Learning 

My contributions:
<ol>
<li> Set up hardware chips, simulation environment 

and light-weighted real-time data pipelines to get TB magnitudes of data on physical layer of wireless data transmission </li>
<li> Designed a deep learning model deepPHY, to surpass Bit and Package Error Rate(BER & PER) of 802.11ax PHY baseline from traditional channel estimation methods, especially on low SNR cases </li>
</ol>
