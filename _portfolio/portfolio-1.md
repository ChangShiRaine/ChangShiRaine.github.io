When GPS signals are not accessible indoors, Fine Timing Measurement (FTM) procedure between the Mobile device (STA) and Network infrastructure device (AP) is used to serve for indoor positioning. While pure FTM-based localization is noise sensitive, the various senors on the Mobile devices may assist to correct the error and improve the localization accuracy. 

In this project, we implemented an ios phone SDK to get IMU sensor data from the phone and location estimation from FTM while ensuring information security based on access control. We then used fusion algorithms to combine AP data with phone sensor data to do path-matching and improved indoor localization accuracy.
