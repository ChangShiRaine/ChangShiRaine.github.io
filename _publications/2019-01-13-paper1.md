In this paper, we introduce an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for graph-based semi-supervised multi-class classification problems. We not only predict the class label for each data point, but also provide a confidence score for the prediction. We adopt a Bayesian approach and propose a graphical multi-class probit model together with an effective Gibbs sampling procedure. Furthermore, we propose a confidence measure for each data point that correlates with the classification performance. We use the empirical properties of the proposed confidence measure to guide the design of a human-in-the-loop system. The uncertainty quantification algorithm and the human-in-the-loop system are successfully applied to classification problems in image processing and ego-motion analysis of body-worn videos.
