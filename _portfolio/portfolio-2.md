Conventional Channel estimation and qualization for OFDM is a pretty mature technique, but deep learning has emerged to be a new effective tool for channel estimation in wireless communication systems. In this project, We designed and tested several neural networks with different architectures, proved that with sufficient training data, deep learning models can surpass 802.11ax PHY baseline with conventional channel estimation, especially in the low Signal-Noise Ratio cases.
